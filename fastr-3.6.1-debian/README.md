# FastR 3.6.1 on Debian

You can build it manually using this command from the directory of this file:

```bash
make build-dockeRs
```

Or run R from the docker image

```bash
make run-dockeRs
```

## Credit

The Dockerfile is taken from [here](https://github.com/graalvm/examples/issues/6#issuecomment-569954511). I only modified a very small part.
