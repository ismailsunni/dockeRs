# MRO 3.5.3 on Arch Linux

There is no available installer for MRO on Arch Linux in this [MRO download page](https://mran.microsoft.com/download) and it is not offically supported for Arch Linux.

There is perhaps a possibility to build from source as mentioned in this [FAQ page](https://mran.microsoft.com/faq) but I haven't tried to do it. I have asked about the possibility to do it in [this Github issue](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-r-open/issues/111).
